There's not much to say about this one.  Honestly, I wonder if I'm
missing something subtle, because if I understand this question
correctly it's like FizzBuzz but without any of the edge cases or
interesting questions of extensibility.

    void reverse(char *s) {
      char tmp;
      char *t = s + strlen(s) - 1;
      while (s < t) {
        tmp = *s;
        *s++ = *t;
        *t-- = tmp;
      }
    }
