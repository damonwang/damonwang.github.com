As a fan of DIY _Science!_, I was pretty excited when my friend WJ sent
me an [old Mother Jones
article](http://www.motherearthnews.com/Sustainable-Farming/1977-11-01/Fresh-Eggs.aspx)
([local copy](/archive/lrs-rewrite/eggs.txt)) in which the editors
tested several methods of egg storage.  Unfortunately, the article was
so poorly written that I could hardly find their actual results.  As a
writing exercise for myself, I've rewritten the article in the style of
the Little Red Schoolhouse, and added a brief discussion of what I hoped
my rewrite would accomplish.

Rewritten Article
=================

"How can I save the surplus eggs from one month to eat six or eight
months later?"  This is one of the questions most frequently asked by
MOTHER readers who must reconcile their family's fairly constant rate of
egg consumption with their hens' highly seasonal rate of egg production.
Although many methods are discussed in old farm magazines and ancient
Department of Agriculture pamphlets, we know of no empirical studies
testing the effectiveness of those methods.  

Therefore, we here present preliminary results after seven months of our
own year-long controlled study.  Among the ten methods tested, the best
by far is refrigeration.  At 35 to 40 F, eggs look, smell, and taste
almost fresh for more than seven months.  At room temperature, the best
method is waterglass.  Immersed in a 10% waterglass solution, eggs stay
edible for up to five months.  For every method tested, homegrown eggs
lasted much longer than supermarket eggs.  We attribute this difference
to the supermarkets' practice of washing off the protective bloom.

The remainder of this article presents the experimental design,
tabulated results after seven months, and detailed recommendations.

In our study, ten groups of three dozen washed, unfertile supermarket
eggs and ten groups of three dozen unwashed, fertile homegrown eggs (for
a total of 720 eggs) were stored for seven months by various methods.
Each month, we randomly selected several eggs from each group to check
for freshness by smell and buoyance.  If no spoilage was evident, the
egg was cracked open, inspected visually, and then tasted.  Except for
the _Refrigerated_ group, all eggs were kept between 65 and 70 F.

We'll report back again next spring after our study has run its full
year-long course, but based on the preliminary results after seven
months, we can make the following recommendations to any readers who
would like to preserve their surplus eggs to eat later in the year.

Your eggs will last longest and taste best if left unwashed and
refrigerated in an air-tight container at 35 to 40 F.  The whites may
become slightly runnier after two months, but will firm up again after
four.  Otherwise, the flavor and texture will remain nearly
indistinguishable from fresh-laid eggs for more than seven months.

If no refrigeration is available, immersion in waterglass is the next
best option, keeping unwashed eggs tasting good for up to five months
and edible for more than seven.  Prick waterglassed eggs before boiling
them, as the shells will no longer be porous enough to vent steam.

If neither refrigeration nor waterglass is available, immersion in lime
water, packing in lard, or coating with lard can keep unwashed eggs
edible almost as well as waterglass can.

Regardless of the storage method used, remember to crack old eggs into
a separate cup and check for spoilage before mixing it with other
ingredients.  Every group we tested had a few eggs which spoiled much
earlier than the rest of the group.  

Discussion
==========

The biggest change I made in this rewrite was to cut out the
month-by-month narration of their study in favor of a point-first
structure that more directly addresses the reader's presumed needs
(namely, how do I store all these eggs?)
